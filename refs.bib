  abstract = {We propose a hierarchical attention network for document classification. Our model has two distinctive characteristics: (i) it has a hierarchical structure that mirrors the hierarchicalhttps://pt.overleaf.com/1279382319bkqzzqdbcrtt structure of documents; (ii) it has two levels of attention mechanisms applied at the wordand sentence-level, enabling it to attend differentially to more and less important content when constructing the document representation. Experiments conducted on six large scale text classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperform previous methods by a substantial margin. Visualization of the attention layers illustrates that the model selects qualitatively informative words and sentences.},

ABSTRACT = {Stemming algorithms are commonly used during textual preprocessing phase in order to reduce data dimensionality. However, this reduction presents different efficacy levels depending on the domain that it is applied to. Thus, for instance, there are reports in the literature that show the effect of stemming when applied to dictionaries or textual bases of news. On the other hand, we have not found any studies analyzing the impact of radicalization on Brazilian judicial jurisprudence, composed of decisions handed down by the judiciary, a fundamental instrument for law professionals to play their role. Thus, this work presents two complete experiments, showing the results obtained through the analysis and evaluation of the stemmers applied on real jurisprudential documents, originating from the Court of Justice of the State of Sergipe. In the first experiment, the results showed that, among the analyzed algorithms, the RSLP (Removedor de Sufixos da Lingua Portuguesa) possessed the greatest capacity of dimensionality reduction of the data. In the second one, through the evaluation of the stemming algorithms on the legal documents retrieval, the RSLP-S (Removedor de Sufixos da Lingua Portuguesa Singular) and UniNE (University of Neuchâtel), less aggressive stemmers, presented the best cost-benefit ratio, since they reduced the dimensionality of the data and increased the effectiveness of the information retrieval evaluation metrics in one of analyzed collections.},

abstract = {Tools for automatic subject assignment help deal with scale and sustainability in creating and enriching metadata, establishing more connections across and between resources and enhancing consistency. Although some software vendors and experimental researchers claim the tools can replace manual subject indexing, hard scientific evidence of their performance in operating information environments is scarce. A major reason for this is that research is usually conducted in laboratory conditions, excluding the complexities of real-life systems and situations. The article reviews and discusses issues with existing evaluation approaches such as problems of aboutness and relevance assessments, implying the need to use more than a single “gold standard” method when evaluating indexing and retrieval, and proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework. The framework is informed by a systematic review of the literature on evaluation approaches: evaluating indexing quality directly through assessment by an evaluator or through comparison with a gold standard, evaluating the quality of computer-assisted indexing directly in the context of an indexing workflow, and evaluating indexing quality indirectly through analyzing retrieval performance.}

abstract = {Abstract In litigation in the US, the parties are obligated to produce to one another, when requested, those documents that are potentially relevant to issues and facts of the litigation (called “discovery”). As the volume of electronic documents continues to grow, the expense of dealing with this obligation threatens to surpass the amounts at issue and the time to identify these relevant documents can delay a case for months or years. The same holds true for government investigations and third-parties served with subpoenas. As a result, litigants are looking for ways to reduce the time and expense of discovery. One approach is to supplant or reduce the traditional means of having people, usually attorneys, read each document, with automated procedures that use information retrieval and machine categorization to identify the relevant documents. This study compared an original categorization, obtained as part of a response to a Department of Justice Request and produced by having one or more of 225 attorneys review each document with automated categorization systems provided by two legal service providers. The goal was to determine whether the automated systems could categorize documents at least as well as human reviewers could, thereby saving time and expense. The results support the idea that machine categorization is no less accurate at identifying relevant/responsive documents than employing a team of reviewers. Based on these results, it would appear that using machine categorization can be a reasonable substitute for human review.}

abstract = "Internet data sources provide us with large image datasets which are mostly without any explicit labeling. This setting is ideal for semi-supervised learning which seeks to exploit labeled data as well as a large pool of unlabeled data points to improve learning and classification. While we have made considerable progress on the theory and algorithms, we have seen limited success to translate such progress to the large scale datasets which these methods are inspired by. We investigate the computational complexity of popular graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms together with different possible speed-ups. Our findings lead to a new algorithm that scales up to 40 times larger datasets in comparison to previous approaches and even increases the classification performance. Our method is based on the key insights that by employing a density-based measure unlabeled data points can be selected similar to an active learning scheme. This leads to a compact graph resulting in an improved performance up to 11.6{\%} at reduced computational costs.",
